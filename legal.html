  	<h2 id="privacypolicy">Privacy Policy</h2>
		<ol>
			<li><b>Data Collection and Storage</b>
				<ol>
					<!--<h3>Identify what data, if any, the app/service collects, how it collects that data, and all uses of that data.</h3>-->
					<li>Submarine Two does not collect or share user data with any 3rd parties or services besides Reddit. Submarine Two uses the Reddit OAuth API to authenticate Reddit accounts in order to allow voting and other actions through the app. <!--Once authenticated, the access token is secured in the iOS keychain. The username is saved locally outside of the keychain and used as a key to get the access token retrieved at the end of the OAuth process. The "hide" feature exclusively uses the Reddit API. The "mute" feature stores keywords and filters out posts locally, and thus does not send this information to Reddit. The "visited" feature stores tapped post information locally and does not send or receive this information from Reddit or any other service.--></li>

					<!--<h3>Confirm that any third party with whom an app shares user data (in compliance with these Guidelines) — such as analytics tools, advertising networks and third-party SDKs, as well as any parent, subsidiary or other related entities that will have access to user data — will provide the same or equal protection of user data as stated in the app’s privacy policy and required by these Guidelines.</h3>-->
					<li>No analytics tools, advertising networks, or third-party SDKs are used in Submarine Two.</li>

					<!--<h3>Explain its data retention/deletion policies and describe how a user can revoke consent and/or request deletion of the user’s data.</h3>-->
					<li>User data is only saved locally in Submarine Two and can be erased by signing out inside the app or deleting the app. Permission to use the Reddit API can be revoked via Reddit anytime at: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/">https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/</a>.</li>
				</ol></li>
			</li>

			<li><b>Permission</b>
				<ol>
					<!--<h3>Apps that collect user or usage data must secure user consent for the collection, even if such data is considered to be anonymous at the time of or immediately following collection. Paid functionality must not be dependent on or require a user to grant access to this data. Apps must also provide the customer with an easily accessible and understandable way to withdraw consent. Ensure your purpose strings clearly and completely describe your use of the data. Apps that collect data for a legitimate interest without consent by relying on the terms of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) or similar statute must comply with all terms of that law.</h3>-->
					<li>You (the End-User) consent to the collection of data as explained in the Data Collection and Storage section above. To opt-out of any user data being transmitted, do not sign into a Reddit account when using Submarine Two.</li>
				</ol></li>
			</li>

			<li><b>Data Minimization</b>
				<ol>
					<!--<h3>Apps should only request access to data relevant to the core functionality of the app and should only collect and use data that is required to accomplish the relevant task. Where possible, use the out-of-process picker or a share sheet rather than requesting full access to protected resources like Photos or Contacts.</h3>-->
					<li>Only relevant data to core functionality is collected in Submarine Two. Share sheets are used instead of access to protected resources wherever possible in Submarine Two.</li>
				</ol></li>
			</li>

			<li><b>Access</b>
				<ol>
					<!--Apps must respect the user’s permission settings and not attempt to manipulate, trick, or force people to consent to unnecessary data access. For example, apps that include the ability to post photos to a social network must not also require microphone access before allowing the user to upload photos. Where possible, provide alternative solutions for users who don’t grant consent. For example, if a user declines to share Location, offer the ability to manually enter an address.-->
					<li>Submarine Two respects the user's permissions settings and does not attempt to manipulate, trick, or force people to consent to unnecessary data access.</li>
				</ol></li>
			</li>

			<li><b>Account Sign-In</b>
				<ol>
					<!--If your app doesn’t include significant account-based features, let people use it without a log-in. Apps may not require users to enter personal information to function, except when directly relevant to the core functionality of the app or required by law. If your core app functionality is not related to a specific social network (e.g. Facebook, WeChat, Weibo, Twitter, etc.), you must provide access without a login or via another mechanism. Pulling basic profile information, sharing to the social network, or inviting friends to use the app are not considered core app functionality. The app must also include a mechanism to revoke social network credentials and disable data access between the app and social network from within the app. An app may not store credentials or tokens to social networks off of the device and may only use such credentials or tokens to directly connect to the social network from the app itself while the app is in use.-->
					<li>Submarine Two can be used without logging in. At any time, accounts can be added or removed in the Submarine Two app. All sensitive information about these accounts stays on the device and is not transmitted to any network besides Reddit when authenticating.</li>
				</ol></li>
			</li>

			<li><b>SafariViewController</b>
				<ol>
					<!--SafariViewController must be used to visibly present information to users; the controller may not be hidden or obscured by other views or layers. Additionally, an app may not use SafariViewController to track users without their knowledge and consent.-->
					<li>SafariViewController is used in an obvious and unobscured way. It can opened to a direct link or permalink for Reddit content by tapping "Open in Safari" from a share sheet.</li>
				</ol></li>
			</li>

			<li><b>Surreptitious Data Collection</b>
				<ol>
					<!--Developers that use their apps to surreptitiously discover passwords or other private data will be removed from the Developer Program. 
					Apps that compile personal information from any source that is not directly from the user or without the user’s explicit consent, even public databases, are not permitted on the App Store.
					-->
					<li>Submarine Two does not surreptitiously discover passwords or private data.</li>
